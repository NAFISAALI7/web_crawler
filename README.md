Create a web crawler using python that is able to scrape first 10,000 results for the following google search input
A web crawler, also known as a spider or a web scraper, is a program that automatically navigates through web pages, retrieves information from them, and extracts relevant data. It follows links on web pages and recursively visits other pages to gather data. Web crawlers are commonly used for tasks like web indexing, data mining, and content scraping.

Now, let's break down the code and explain it in paragraph format:

The provided code uses Python to create a web crawler that scrapes YouTube channels based on a given search query. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The necessary libraries, `requests`, `csv`, and `json`, are imported to enable HTTP requests, CSV file handling, and JSON operations, respectively.

2. A function named `scrape_youtube_channels` is defined, which takes two parameters: `search_query` (the query to search for YouTube channels) and `num_channels` (the number of channels to retrieve).

3. An API key is assigned to the `api_key` variable. This key is required to make requests to the YouTube Data API and needs to be replaced with an actual API key obtained from the Google Cloud Console.

4. The base URL for the YouTube Data API search endpoint is assigned to the `base_url` variable.

5. A dictionary named `params` is created to store the parameters for the API request. It includes the API key, the part to retrieve (snippet), the search query, the type of results to retrieve (channel), and the maximum number of channels to retrieve (`num_channels`).

6. A GET request is made to the YouTube API search endpoint using the `requests.get` function, passing the `base_url` and `params` as arguments. The response is assigned to the `response` variable.

7. The JSON data from the response is extracted using the `response.json()` method and assigned to the `data` variable.

8. The structure of the response is printed using `print(data)` to help understand its content and structure.

9. An empty list called `channels` is initialized to store the YouTube channel links.

10. If the 'items' key exists in the `data` dictionary, a loop is executed to extract the channel ID and construct the corresponding channel link. The channel link is appended to the `channels` list.

11. If the 'items' key does not exist in the `data` dictionary, a message is printed indicating that no items were found in the response.

12. The `channels` list is returned from the function.

13. The search query and the desired number of channels are defined.

14. The `scrape_youtube_channels` function is called with the search query and the number of channels as arguments. The result is assigned to the `channels` variable.

15. A CSV file named 'youtube_channels.csv' is created, and the extracted channel links are written to it using the `csv.writer` object. The first row specifies the column header as 'Channel Links'.

16. A JSON file named 'youtube_channels.json' is created. The `channels` list is stored in a dictionary named `data`, and the dictionary is dumped into the JSON file using the `json.dump` function.

In summary, this code utilizes the YouTube Data API to search for YouTube channels based on a given query. The channels' URLs are extracted from the API response and stored in a CSV file and a JSON file for further analysis or use.
